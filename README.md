# HerRhythm
The HerRhythm is a web-based application designed to help women monitor and manage their menstrual health with ease. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system provides a user-friendly interface with a personalized experience for each user.


Upon logging in with their name and date of birth, users can input details such as their last period date, average cycle length, and period duration. Based on this data, the system predicts:


✅ Next period dates
✅ Fertile window & ovulation day
✅ Cycle calendar visualization (with highlighted important dates)


The tracker also includes a Care Guide section that provides:
Hygiene tips for maintaining menstrual health 🩸
Cramp relief exercises 🧘‍♀️
Suggested foods to reduce cravings and mood swings 🥗


Additionally, the application features a notes section, allowing users to add, save, and delete personal notes for specific dates, ensuring important health-related information is stored securely and easily accessible.


Key features also include:

🎨 Smooth animations and girly color themes for an engaging experience.
📅 Monthly calendar navigation across any year.
🔐 Logout option for session management.
This project demonstrates strong skills in frontend development, UI/UX design, user interactivity with JavaScript, and personalized health tracking applications. It not only enhances technical skills but also addresses a meaningful real-world problem by empowering women to take control of their menstrual health.
